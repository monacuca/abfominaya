## Abstract:
We show that a linear model is sufficient to accurately estimate the quantity of yarn that goes into a knitted item produced on an automated knitting machine. Knitted fabrics are complex structures, yet their diverse properties arise from the arrangement of a small number of discrete, additive operations. One can estimate the masses of each of these basic yarn additions using linear regression and, in turn, use these masses to estimate the overall quantity (and local distribution) of yarn within any knitted fabric. Our proposed linear model achieves low error on a range of fabrics and generalizes to different yarns and stitch sizes. This paves the way for applications where having a known yarn distribution is important for accuracy (e.g., simulation) or cost estimation (e.g., design).
