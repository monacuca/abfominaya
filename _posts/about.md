My name is Angelica Bonilla (A. B.) Fominaya and I am an artist, engineer and researcher interested in human-computer interaction, robotic creativity and immersive technologies! 
<br>
<br>
While a student at CMU, I had the opportunity to lead CMU's MoonBuddy Team in the NASA SUITS Challenge, which culminated in physically testing our interface at NASA Johnson Space Center.
<br>
<br>
As an artist, I am interested in exploring different ways in which people can collaborate with machines, specifically towards co-creation. My recent work explores computerized machine knitting, plotters, and collaborative robot arms to address different elements of generativity and interaction.
<br>
<br>
Right now, I am a software engineer at Google and recently receieved the Judson-Morrissey Excellence in New Media Award (2023).
