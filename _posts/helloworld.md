Hello world. 

I thought it would be nice to set up a blog-style posting mechanism for my personal site. 
This site is simple and very much a WIP, but the goal of this was to revamp my own personal website into something more scalable.

I  have been dealing a lot with this feeling of inadequacy as I become complacent on my daily life. As a student, the expectation imposed on us was to focus on our projects and build a body of work that would make us employable. As an employee, the expectation now is to work for the establishment. As an artist, the expectation I set myself to keep making, remains. 

I remind myself that time is not infinite, but what matters is the times we create, as opposed to the times when we don't. I am not paying attention to the gap between art projects, I am looking at what exists and remains.
