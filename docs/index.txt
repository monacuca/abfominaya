## Abstract:
We introduce solid knitting, a new fabrication technique that combines the layer-by-layer volumetric approach of 3D printing with the topologically-entwined stitch structure of knitting to produce solid 3D objects. We define the basic building blocks of solid knitting and demonstrate a working prototype of a solid knitting machine controlled by a low-level instruction language, along with a volumetric design tool for creating machine-knittable patterns. Solid knitting uses a course-wale-layer structure, where every loop in a solid-knit object passes through both a loop from the previous layer and a loop from the previous course. Our machine uses two beds of latch needles to create stitches like a conventional V-bed knitting machine, but augments these needles with a pair of rotating hook arrays to provide storage locations for all of the loops in one layer of the object. It can autonomously produce solid-knit prisms of arbitrary length, although it requires manual intervention to cast on the first layer and bind off the final row. Our design tool allows users to create solid knitting patterns by connecting elementary stitches; objects designed in our interface can---after basic topological checks and constraint propagation---be exported as a sequence of instructions for fabrication on the solid knitting machine. We validate our solid knitting hardware and software on prism examples, detail the mechanical errors which we have encountered, and discuss potential extensions to the capability of our solid knitting machine.

## Abstract:
We show that a linear model is sufficient to accurately estimate the quantity of yarn that goes into a knitted item produced on an automated knitting machine. Knitted fabrics are complex structures, yet their diverse properties arise from the arrangement of a small number of discrete, additive operations. One can estimate the masses of each of these basic yarn additions using linear regression and, in turn, use these masses to estimate the overall quantity (and local distribution) of yarn within any knitted fabric. Our proposed linear model achieves low error on a range of fabrics and generalizes to different yarns and stitch sizes. This paves the way for applications where having a known yarn distribution is important for accuracy (e.g., simulation) or cost estimation (e.g., design).
5:Te89,Various types of algorithmic textile approaches have been historically employed to create soft objects– from the use of industrial knitting fabrics using computerized knitting or weaving machines to 3D knitting of hollow materials (to create objects such as plush toys, socks or shirts). Currently, there are developments allowing for the construction of completely solidly knit objects. For my capstone I am interested in constructing a series of knit objects for a large-scale installation. Specifically, I wanted to use 3D knitting, solid knitting, and computerized machine knitting to create a fully knit installation. I was able to successfully accomplish this. 

## Background
Knitting is an algorithmically complex process that has been extensively studied by computer scientists, mathematicians, designers and engineers. Traditionally, it has served as one of the foundations of society, providing us with footwear, clothing, accessories and equipment. It is a craft associated with labor politics, femininity and traditionalism — yet it is also a craft that we wear on an almost-daily basis. As a craft, it is one of the oldest in existence, rivaled only by weaving.  It is an integral part of our history and it contains thematic and computational value that deserves to be explored.  Solid knitting is a novel type of knitting that is being currently developed at the CMU Textiles Lab. With solid knitting, we have the potential to create completely solid knit objects, thus allowing us to create knit furniture and other types of sturdy objects. Other methods of knit-based fabrication, such as computerized machine knitting provide ways of algorithmically constructing complex 3D hollow objects or patterns. 

When I was ten years old, I immigrated to the United States from Colombia. I only ever went back twice until the time I graduated from high school. This discrepancy in space and time made me feel like Frankenstein’s monster, stitched together from two worlds in the worst possible way. I knew other kids in my community who regularly had the ability to visit family members and friends. I didn’t have this opportunity, living with an undocumented mother, a sick grandmother, and an alcoholic, dying uncle. 

Through my time in the US, I moved more than ten times. Either between the couches of different family members, or scrappy furnished apartments, filled with stained upholstery and cockroaches. I lost the vision of what a home as a space was supposed to be. When I lived in Colombia, most of the furniture we owned had been in our family for decades. It had seen my mother grow up and was a staple of stability in my childhood. I never questioned the eternity of those objects. 

As a teenager and young adult, I made various pieces to address this disconnect. This emotion developed into my current artistic practice and motivates a lot of the questions I ask myself. 

As an adult, I think a lot about preserving myself and my culture. I think about maintaining the spaces and elements that made these temporary living spaces into homes. Fundamentally, a home is the people, but also the culture you exist within. The idea of constructing objects that are modifiable and that can be compressed into a box is an intimate and emotional idea for me. All that is left behind of my childhood is images and memories, subject to physical, digital or mental decay. 

For this reason, I wanted to create a fragment of this space in real life. I built a completely knit chair that can easily be assembled and disassembled by a person. I built a set where people can position themselves unknowingly in my cultural context. They can wear my mask, forced to become a version of me.6:T758,## Video

## About this project:
This project is a piece that contextualizes my failure in attempting to have a robot dance with me.
My goal, at its core, was creating a robotic interaction that would follow me as I moved or danced with it. But I wasn't able to get quite there. I spent roughly 2 months continuously debugging a UR5 Cobot (Collaborative Robot), as I attempted to have it follow my face in real time.  Using Handsfree.js, Python and a couple of dozen cups of coffee, I was able to partially achieve this daunting task. Without getting too much into the technical implementation of my robotic interactions, I had a lot of issues wrapping my head around different SDK's and networking protocols for communicating with the robot with my computer.

It's not easy to make code for the robot to move, but it's even harder to do so remotely from your computer. So I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how these pieces went together. I eventually hacked it, but I realized that to get to a step where the robot would be able to move smoothly with me, would take a lot more time and effort than I had. At this point I had grown bitter with the robot, verbally abusing it every time I could. Because I knew it would never be good enough to properly dance with me at this rate.


Needless to say, this piece as a whole is a testament to the technical failures that I experienced, technical failures that made me reconsider my position as a technologist. This piece was the process of coming to terms with my lack of technical expertise, but it is also a testament to my learning and a love letter to my culture and my language.

## About this project:
(For the best experience, please wear headphones)

For this project, I was interested in exploring the variation that exists through the sensory experiences of different human beings. As someone who is rather sensitive to sound due to misophonia, I was interested in how different people react to different unusual sounds. For example, chewing sounds might be appealing to someone who experiences ASMR or absolutely distressing (and even enraging) for someone who has misphonia.  Most people lie somewhere in between these two experiences, and through their faces they reveal a lot about how they experience these distinct auditory inputs.

Throughout multiple iterations of this project, I was interested in exploring the variety that exists in human emotions-- whether they be my own or someone else's. Upon exploring auditory input, I was introduced to this project by Olivia Cunnally, which captures Grima — a mostly universal response to deeply unsettling sounds. Since sound is something I struggle with, I decided to double down on this idea.

To create this project, I had to first generate the audio using a 3Dio Binaural microphone. This binaural microphone accurately places auditory input in 3D space, making it feel like sounds are either close or further from you. With a combination of hand sanitizer, water, my mouth and pin, I was able to generate an array of sounds to sample from. I ended up with approximately 30 minutes of audio. I then chose the most disturbing audio samples (through the feedback of my friends Bella and Lauren) and used them to create a 5 minute video.

I then recorded various reactions from unsuspecting participants using my phone's 240 fps slow-motion camera. I told each person that they would be listening to 5 minutes of potentially distressing audio and that I would be recording their reactions. Finally, I compiled 12 of the video reactions I recorded into a 4 x 3 grid with their reactions synchronized to the audio. The video and audio were slowed down by a factor of 0.5, to make expressions more dramatic.

Overall, I am very pleased with how this project turned out. I am not someone who regularly works either with video or audio, so I know there is a lot of room for improvement in how I conducted my project. First, I think there might be a couple of points where the video isn't perfectly synchronized to the audio.  I think this is due to me synchronizing the videos using the original audio of the video clips themselves (via a click) and joining them. Instead I should've used visual cues to make this easier for myself (having people clap, for instance).  I do think this is something I can revise, but I have been having issues with the size of my project, so exporting and editing has been taking a very long time (I will not use Lightworks again). In the end, I am still very pleased with the final outcome but I have learned to be more cognizant of my videography for the future!<br>

## About this project:
This project emerged as an exploration of the complex history of banana 
cultivation in the Colombian Caribbean. Earlier this semester, I visited 
this region of Colombia and noticed the subtle ways
in which the banana industry impacted the language, culture, and
stories people told. This industry also fundamentally shaped relations
within the region and instituted ecological and political violence,
prompting generations of unspoken trauma. Chiquita, formerly
known as the United Fruit Company, massacred thousands of banana
workers in Magdalena in 1928 and since then this company has not
relented its grip on the region, to the point of instituting paramil-
tary violence against its workers until 2018 to prevent any halt in
banana cultivation.


Aside from the influence of the American Banana industries, this
region has a rich history, culture, and mythos. I am fascinated by the
mythological complexity of these stories, and for this reason, I chose
to make this film about Mojana. In this film, I used illustrations to
recount Mojana's surreal narrative and omnipotence in conjunction
with Toto la Momposina's Mojana. Mojana is a spirit that rep-
resents a post-colonial Colombian woman, who has chosen to adv-
cate for freedom in her life, becoming one with the Magdalena River.


Yet in the lyrics of the song, there's a struggle to restrain her. By
making Mojana a protector of the forest and people, her story is a
stand-in for resilience.


Visually, I considered using color and embedded subtitles with my own
font in the video itself, however as I was making the video I realized
that these elements might take away from the power of the visuals
of the piece. For this reason, I opted to use adjustable captioning
which could be toggled.9:T7ee,# MoonBuddy: A Voice-based Augmented Reality User Interface That Supports Astronauts During Extravehicular Activities.

## Abstract:
As NASA pursues Artemis missions to the moon and beyond, it is 
essential to equip astronauts with the appropriate human-autonomy 
enabling technology necessary for the elevated demands of lunar 
surface exploration and extreme terrestrial access. We present 
MoonBuddy, an application built for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 that 
utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) and voice-based interaction to assist 
astronauts in communication, navigation, and documentation on 
future lunar extravehicular activities (EVAs), with the goal of reducing 
cognitive load and increasing effective task completion.
We performed a preliminary evaluation at the Johnson Space Center,
Houston, TX, USA, in an area that simulates the lunar surface and
its lighting conditions. During testing, participants used MoonBuddy to 
navigate to three different geological sampling sites, collect rock 
samples, and perform a search and rescue mission to find a distressed 
crew member. Overall, participants appreciated the simple voice 
commands, the guided nature of MoonBuddy, and the surface
edge detection feature that helped them avoid hazards during navigation.

## Personal note:
I led and organized team of 8 designers, artists and programmers to develop an AR application for EVA
assistance, which we had the opportunity to test NASA Johnson Space Center. We wrote a poster and paper
detailing implementation details, which was accepted and is to be presented in UIST'22. To create this project
we received grants from the Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium and Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute.a:T817,For this project, there were two main topics I wanted to research and integrate. First, I wanted to examine how movements
spread and communicate, specifically in the context of Latin American feminism. I also wanted to explore the intimacy
of printmaking, its purpose in spreading information, and how this could be integrated with algorithmic processes as a bridge of two distinct languages. I began this project by parsing through hundreds of videos of modern-day protest performances
in various Latin American cities, many of these performances utilized simple choreographies and lyrics that allowed for easy transmission of the movement itself. These videos originated as a response to various global issues for women, from
femicide and rape to the treatment of women in online settings.

I found that the transmission of information in each video was evocative in the same way prints and written pieces that kickstarted social movements were evocative. My goal at first was to aggregate the content in these videos into new
messages, where each print displayed a different frame of a found video with a distinct call to action in lieu of the lyrics. I made different types of text generators, from Markov Chains to Tracery grammars and traditional generative text
methods.

As I iterated this process, I began to focus more on the lyrical quality of specific videos and I kept coming back to “Un Violador En Tu Camino” (A Rapist in Your Path) by Chilean collective Colectivo Las Tesis. This video was incredibly
striking to me by the raw power it had in mobilizing people and enacting change, despite being a simple (non-violent) communal performance. As such, I sourced my videos and text from this specific work and moved my project towards an adaptation
of this video removing the use of generative text. Using the traditional language in printmaking, I decided to frame each print as a work of art, with the lyrics presented as a title in an editorial print. These prints then got converted into
a gif, recontextualizing them in a digital space.b:T686,
This was an experience for me to make, as I went through hundreds of testimonies 
of victims (or their families) who suffered from the violence from the Colombian military, 
to the ELN, to the different paramilitary groups, to the FARC and female victims of assault 
through the different periods of armed conflict. I have done a lot of projects recently on the idea of constructing archives and stories,
and something that has been on my mind a lot recently is the lived experiences of victims and the numerical definitions of massacre and collective trauma. 
So in this project, I created a clock that through the period of ten minutes, displays a unique version of these stories. To be able to view this clock, 
the left-most side displays the current minute represented by the number of words, the middle column represents the ten's place digit of the seconds 
(thus it changes every 10 seconds) and the rightmost column represents the one's digit.

The hardest part of this piece was trying to find a way of approaching this sensitive topic 
in a proper and respectful way, I translated a lot of the anecdotes at first quite literally,
but many of the stories were violent and incredibly difficult to digest. There is also often 
a difficulty in trying to describe the violence that exists in Latin America without make it 
the defining quality of these nations. It often feels like as a Colombian, so many of our 
conversations are focused on avoiding the armed conflict as a topic, it felt uncomfortable 
to make this piece but I still made it because it is a very real struggle for many, and 
for those who live it every day through memories.
